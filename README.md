You can compare short-term rental performance against long-term rental options and even Section 8 possibilities, all in one place.

For real estate professionals, BNBCalc includes custom branding features, allowing you to generate polished reports with your business information.

## BNBCalc Reviews

BNBCalc has received positive feedback from the short-term rental investment community, with users praising its practical approach and data accuracy.

**User Experiences:**

Investors appreciate the platform's host-driven design. Since the founders actively manage their own short-term rental portfolio, the tool includes features that matter in real-world situations. Users frequently mention the time savings compared to manual spreadsheet analysis and the confidence that comes from data-backed projections.

The comparable properties feature receives consistent praise. Being able to view up to 40 similar listings on a map, complete with their estimated revenue, amenities, and host information, helps investors benchmark their properties realistically. The percentile revenue ranges show where a property might fall within the competitive landscape.

Real estate professionals value the custom branding functionality. The ability to generate polished reports with their business logo and information, then share them via link or print for client meetings, has become a lead generation tool for many agents and property managers.

**Platform Reliability:**

BNBCalc uses data from established sources including Wheelhouse and Airbtics, with the company noting approximately 5% deviation from actual figures. The founder actively engages with user questions on real estate forums, providing transparency about data sources and methodology.

Independent reviews highlight the platform's intuitive interface and comprehensive financial metrics. Users find the scenario analysis particularly helpful – the ability to adjust assumptions and see how changes in rates, occupancy, or expenses affect profitability helps in preparing for different market conditions.

**Areas for Consideration:**

Some users note that data accuracy depends heavily on the quality of inputs. Taking time to research realistic nightly rates and occupancy levels for your specific market improves projection reliability. The platform works best when combined with local market knowledge.

BNBCalc has built its reputation on practical functionality rather than flashy features. The focus remains on providing the financial insights investors need to make confident decisions about short-term rental properties.
